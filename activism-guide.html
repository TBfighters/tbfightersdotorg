			<h3 id="standards-for-community-conduct">
				<div class="header-copy"><noscript><a
							href="#standards-for-community-conduct"></a></noscript></div>
				Standards for Community Conduct:
			</h3>
			<p>
				Threats, intimidation, degradation, and humiliation are never acceptable within
				Nerdfighteria. We firmly reject harassment, bigotry, ableism, racism, name-calling, hate
				speech, abusive language, or the disclosure of other people’s private information
				without their consent. Within our community, we wholeheartedly promote a safe and
				welcoming environment for everyone.
			</p>
			<br>
			<h3 id="respectful-outreach-and-engagement">
				<div class="header-copy"><noscript><a
							href="#respectful-outreach-and-engagement"></a></noscript></div>
				Standards Respectful Outreach and Engagement:
			</h3>
			<p>
				When engaging with the public or contacting organizations, keep in mind that the
				individuals
				responding to our calls, emails, and tweets may not hold decision-making authority.
				Maintain politeness and respect in all interactions, regardless of any challenges you
				encounter. Remember, we are all complex humans here.
			</p>
			<br>
			<h3 id="using-privilege-responsibly">
				<div class="header-copy"><noscript><a
							href="#using-privilege-responsibly"></a></noscript></div>
				Using Privilege Responsibly:
			</h3>
			<p>
				Utilize your power and privilege for positive impact, contributing to the reduction of
				global suffering. Always keep in mind that our aim is to prioritize and uplift the most
				marginalized individuals and communities. Work alongside them as allies, recognizing
				they often require support and visibility rather than a savior.
			</p>
			<br>
			<h3 id="collective-action-and-unity">
				<div class="header-copy"><noscript><a
							href="#collective-action-and-unity"></a></noscript></div>
				Collective Action and Unity:
			</h3>
			<p>
				To achieve our goals effectively, remember that collective action relies on unity—avoid
				acting independently. If you're uncertain about the appropriateness of your actions or
				tone in relation to our community's efforts, reach out to fellow activists for guidance
				and clarity.
			</p>
			<br>
			<h3 id="collabrative-partnerships">
				<div class="header-copy"><noscript><a href="#collabrative-partnerships"></a></noscript>
				</div>
				Collaborative Partnerships:
			</h3>
			<p>
				Proactively cultivate robust collaborative partnerships. Recognize and appreciate our
				allies, whether they have long been dedicated to the cause or are newcomers eager to
				contribute their energy to our shared success.
			</p>
			<br>
			<h3 id="knowledge-empowers-action">
				<div class="header-copy"><noscript><a href="#knowledge-empowers-action"></a></noscript>
				</div>
				Knowledge Empowers
				Action:
			</h3>
			<p>
				Invest time in gaining a deep understanding of the causes we champion, and actively seek
				out existing research documents and resources compiled by others. Knowledge empowers
				effective action.
			</p>
			<br>
			<h3 id="unified-direction-and-leadership">
				<div class="header-copy"><noscript><a
							href="#unified-direction-and-leadership"></a></noscript></div>
				Unified Direction and Leadership:
			</h3>
			<p>
				Stay focused and follow the guidance of those already engaged in the work, as well as
				any direction provided by John and/or Hank as they signal our collective focus and
				intent.
			</p>
			<br>
			<h3 id="inclusive-and-self-care">
				<div class="header-copy"><noscript><a href="#inclusive-and-self-care"></a></noscript>
				</div>
				Inclusivity and Self-Care:
			</h3>
			<p>
				Nerdfighteria is an unequivocally inclusive community that wholeheartedly embraces
				diversity, ensuring every individual is treated with respect and kindness. Please
				prioritize your self-care and utilize open communication about your specific needs and
				concerns as you see fit.
