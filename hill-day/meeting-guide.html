			<h3>Scheduling Your Meeting</h3>
			<h4>Local Meetings</h4>
			<p>All members of Congress maintain offices in their state/district. To schedule a meeting, we
				suggest you either call their local office or email them, you can find both at <a
					href="https://www.congress.gov/members/find-your-member"
					target="_blank">congress' Find Your Member page.</a> An example email can be
				found below. <i>In your email, you should make sure to note that your meeting will take
					place in the district office.</i></p>
			<a href="https://www.congress.gov/members/find-your-member" class="button" target="_blank">Find
				you member of congress</a>
			<br>
			<br>
			<article class="block">
				<h4>Example Scheduling Email</h4>
				<div id="email-local">
					<p><i>Subject:</i> Constituent meeting request on domestic and global TB
						programs</p>
					<br>
					<p>Hi I’m a constituent from <b>(your town)</b>. I'd like to meet in person at
						your local office for 20-30 minutes to discuss domestic and global TB
						programs with the member or staff if the member is unavailable. Would
						the member have any time on that day to speak with us?</p>
					<br>
					<p>Thank you,</p>

			<p>We suggest sending this email in the morning so its at the top of the Representatives' inbox
				(they get a lot a day). We also suggest following up every couple of days if you haven't
				gotten a response.</p>
			<h4>Virtual Meetings</h4>
			<p>Scheduling a virtual meeting is very similar to a local one and just as impactful! To
				schedule a meeting, we suggest you either call their local office or email them, you can
				find both at <a href="https://www.congress.gov/members/find-your-member"
					target="_blank">congress' Find Your Member page.</a> An example email can be
				found below. <i>In your email, you should make sure to note that your meeting will take
					place virtually!</i></p>

			<h3>The Meeting</h3>
			<p>You will most likely be meeting with a member of the staff, not the Representative or Senator
				themselves. That’s totally okay. The staffer will be nothing but respectful towards you,
				even if they are a rupublican. For the meeting itself, <b>we have made a guide for you
					to follow!</b> You can find it below along with a button to print it out.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Although even meeting will look slightly different, <b>you should aim to have a conversation
					with the staffer/representative, rather than just lecturing them about TB.</b>
				You should always start off with introductions, inform them about tuberculosis and tell
				them the asks (but it won't always happen in that order).
				But this largely depends on the staffer/representative themselves. Oftentimes, the
				staffer/representative will ask you questions, if you know the answer: feel free the
				answer, but if you do not saying "I don't know" will not hurt you case, but you should
				follow up later with the answer! You also don't have to memorize every statistic, word,
				or talking point, you should have gone over the points (and possibly practiced a few
				time), but you can always refer back to the talking points at anytime and it will not
				hurt your case!</p>
			<br>
			<p>As the meeting wraps up, you should leave behind a few papers that give an overview of our
				asks and the general talking points. We have provided you with PDFs below that you can
				print out. <b>If this is not an option for you, or you are meeting virtually, you should
					send the PDFs afterwards in an email!</b></p>

			<h3>Afterwards</h3>
			<p>Afterwards, make sure to follow up with them, especially if they had any questions. <b>In the
					follow up email, you should include the asks and a quick overview of our talking
					points.</b> We have provided a email below for both the house an senate to make
				it easier for you to send said follow up email.</p>
