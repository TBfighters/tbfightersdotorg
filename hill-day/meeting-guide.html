			<h1>Meet With Your Representatives - US</h1>
			<br>
			<p>TB Hill Day is not just an in-person event! If you couldn’t make it this year, we encourage
				you to join in by:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Asking your elected official to sign on to a TB Dear Colleague Letter or thanking
					them if they have.</li>
				<li>Scheduling a virtual/local meeting with your member of Congress if we did not get
					the chance to meet with them on the Hill!</li>
			</ol>
			<p>If you’re a member of any of the <a

					target="_blank">districts listed in this spreadsheet</a>, join in by scheduling
				a meeting! <b>If you live in South Dakota or Arkansas we’d love you to schedule a
					meeting with your Senators as well.</b></p>

			<h3>Scheduling Your Meeting</h3>
			<p>All members of Congress maintain offices in their state/district. You can ask to meet at one
				of their local offices or meet virtually, whichever works for you! To schedule a
				meeting, email the office with your request. You can find contact information using
				Congress’ <a href="https://www.congress.gov/members/find-your-member"
					target="_blank">Find Your Members tool</a>. An example email can be found below.
				Send the email through the contact form on your member’s site or an email address there.
				Also keep an eye out for a scheduling form on their site! In your email, you should make
				sure to note whether you’d like the meeting to take place online or in a local office.

					<p><i>Subject:</i> Constituent meeting request on domestic and global TB
						programs</p>
					<br>
					<p>Hi, I’m a constituent from <b>[your town]</b>. I'd like to meet
						<b>[virtually, online | in the member’s local office at address]</b> for
						20-30 minutes to discuss domestic and global TB programs with the member
						or staff if the member is unavailable. Would the member have any time on
						<b>[dates or times when you’re available]</b> to speak with me?
					</p>

				Schedule this email to send at 9 AM ET so it's at the top of the staffer’s inbox—emails
				can
				get lost! We also suggest following up every couple of days by email or putting in a
				call to the member’s local office until you have the meeting scheduled.
			</p>
			<p>Email us at <a href="mailto:tbhillday@gmail.com" target="_blank">tbhillday@gmail.com</a> to
				let us know if
				you’d like a fellow advocate to join your meeting, and we’ll do our best to match you up
				with someone!</p>

		<section class="wrapper">
			<h3>The Meeting</h3>
			<p>To prepare for your meeting, go over statistics, talking points (linked below), and plan what
				you’re going to say! Meeting should follow a general outline of:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Introductions.</li>
				<li>Why you care/how TB affects you and your community.</li>
				<li><a href="talking-points.html#asks-international">Global asks</a></li>
				<li><a href="talking-points.html#domestic-international">Domestic asks</a></li>
				<li>Thank you</li>
			</ol>
			<p>But be flexible! Your goal is to maintain a conversation with the member or their staff, not
				lecture them. Take notes on your conversation, and don’t be scared to say “I don’t know”
				and follow up after your meeting!</p>
			<br>
			<p>You can watch our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRNM7tXlhk&t=1803s"
					target="_blank">webinar with Partners In Health on scheduling meetings</a> from
				the 30-minute mark for a mock meeting. You can also find some <a
					href="talking-points.html">talking points</a>. Don’t
				worry too much about following the script perfectly—just sharing the top line asks and
				why you’re passionate about TB are the most important parts. It is our representatives’
				and their staff’s job to meet with constituents and hear where they want government
				resources allocated.</p>
			<br>
			<p>For information on TB in your area and your member’s record on TB legislation, see the
				<a href="https://tbfightertofu.github.io/hill_day/moc_list.html">Congressional
					Tuberculosis Tracker</a> by TBFighter Tofu. For our asks to the member and
				their staffer, consult <a href="talking-points.html#asks">the talking points page</a>.

				<a href="talking-points.html" class="button" target="_blank">Talking points</a>
				<button class="button button-subtle" onclick="printPage();">Print talking
					points</button>
			</div>
			<br>
			<p>As your meeting comes to a close, be sure to send along a copy of the leave-behind document,
				physically or as a PDF, and make sure you have the staffer’s contact information to
				follow up after the meeting!</p>
