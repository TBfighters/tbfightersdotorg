			<h2 id="tb-facts">TB Facts</h2>
			<p>You do not have to memorize any of these.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Broad</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Most TB is fully curable (and has been for over 50 years).</li>
				<li>TB adversely affects communities with greater obstacles to health.
					<ul>
						<li>Drivers of TB globally include poverty-related risk factors such as
							malnutrition, crowded and poorly ventilated living and working
							conditions.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<br>
			<hr>
			<br>

			<h3>Domestic</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><b>In 2024, there were over 10,000 cases in the US and over 500 deaths.</b></li>
				<li>The US saw an <b>8%</b> increase in TB cases in 2024.</li>
				<li>It mostly affects marginalized communities.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Why its important</h4>
			<p>Here are some reasons to give to your representative on why funding <i>domestic</i> TB
				efforts is important (but please customize these or throw in new ones when you meet with
				your representative!):</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Racial Justice:</b>
					<ul>
						<li>88.1% of reported TB cases in the US are among racial and ethnic
							minority groups according to the CDC.</li>
						<li>People who spend time in crowded living conditions with poor access
							to medical care, such as homeless shelters and correctional
							facilities also have higher rates of TB.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><b>Cost-savings:</b>
					<ul>
						<li>There are huge cost-saving benefits to investing in this preventing
							and mitigating the effects of an outbreak.</li>
						<li>Over 20 years, U.S. TB control efforts averted up to $14.5 billion
							in medical and societal costs from TB deaths. </li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><b>Local Impacts:</b>
					<ul>
						<li>You can find state level information <a
								href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7312a4.htm"
								target="_blank">at the CDC's TB report in 2023.</a>
							These statistics are really useful for customizing your talking
							points to you state to bring home the message.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<br>
			<hr>
			<br>

			<h3>International</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>TB kills <b>1.25 million</b> people each year.</li>
				<li><b>10.8 million</b> people developed TB in 2023.
					<ul>
						<li><b>1.3 million</b> children developed TB in 2023.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>TB represents <b>30%</b> of deaths from antimicrobial resistant bacteria.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Why it's important</h4>
			<p>Here are some reasons to give to your representative on why funding <i>international</i> TB
				efforts is important (but please customize these or throw in new ones when you meet with
				your representative!):</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Maternal and Child Health:</b>
					<ul>
						<li>Every day, almost 600 children die from TB.</li>
						<li>TB accounts for 6–15% of all maternal mortality.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><b>Cost-savings:</b>
					<ul>
						<li>This investment will save us billions of dollars in the long run.
						</li>
						<li>For example, it was more expensive upfront to eradicate smallpox,
							but the United States saves all of its spending on smallpox
							every 26 days because it does not have to vaccinate or treat the
							disease anymore.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><b>Diplomacy:</b>
					<ul>
						<li>In 2023, 110 retired three and four-star generals urged Congress to
							support robust funding for global development projects,
							including USAID, as they wrote that these diplomatic programs
							“are critical to preventing conflict and reducing the need to
							put our men and women in uniform in harm’s way.”</li>
						<li>A healthier, more stable world is better for everyone and funding
							for tuberculosis builds goodwill for the United States</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 id="the-programs">The Programs</h2>

			<h4>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</h4>
			<p>The CDC has two divisions of interest: the <b>Division of TB Elimination</b> and the
				<b>Division of Global HIV and TB</b>, both of which still exist. These divisions are
				paramount for treating tuberculosis patients <i>in the US</i>.
			</p>
			<br>
			<h4>United States Agency for International Development (USAID)</h4>
			<p><a href="../funding-cuts/">Although USAID has been dismantled</a>, it has helped millions of
				people around the world get the drugs and testing they need to survive.</p>
			<br>
			<h4>The Global Fund</h4>
			<p>The Global Fund creates a lot of the groundwork for distributing drugs to the people who need
				them. But, like many other agencies, recent funding cuts have slowed its work, making it
				harder (if not impossible) for people to continue their treatment</p>
			<br>
			<h4>National Institute of Health (NIH)</h4>
			<p>The NIH is very important to the continued research and development of everything related to
				TB. But due to recent funding cuts, TB research—which has already been underfunded—is
				decimated.</p>
			<br>
			<h4>Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs (CDMRP) - Senate Only</h4>
			<p>The CDMRP is a research branch of the Department of Defense that researches diseases
				internationally.</p>
		</section>
		<section class="wrapper">
			<h2 id="asks">Our Asks</h2>
			<h3 id="asks-domestic">Domestic</h3>
			<h4>CDC</h4>
			<p><b>Protect CDC’s Division of TB Elimination; sustain spending at congressionally directed
					levels</b></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Support <b>$225 million in FY 2026</b> for the CDC’s Division of TB Elimination</li>
				<li>Support <b>$21 million in FY 2026</b> for the CDC’s Division of Global HIV and TB
				</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			<h4>NIH</h4>
			<p><b>Support at least $51.303 billion for NIH</b> (as a whole)</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Support at least <b>$7.29 billion</b> for the National Institute of Allergy and
					Infectious Diseases
					(NIAID).</li>
				<li>
					Protect the structure of NIAID and its support for TB research.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<br>
			<hr>
			<br>

			<h3 id="asks-international">International</h3>
			<h4>USAID</h4>
			<p><b>Restore staff and increase funding for global health TB programs</b></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Support <b>$1 billion in Fiscal Year 2026</b> for global bilateral TB efforts.</li>
				<li>Require additional and more frequent reporting that demonstrates appropriated funds
					are
					being spent as intended.</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			<h4>The Global Fund</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Support a contribution of <b>$2 billion</b> to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and
					Malaria. This would unlock another $4 billion other donors during this
					replenishment year.</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			<h4>CDMRP - Senate only</h4>
			<p>Include TB as an eligible disease in the Congressionally Directed Medical
				Research Program’s Peer Reviewed Medical Research Program & restore full funding to the
				program.</p>
			<br>
			<hr>
			<br>
			<h3>Dear Colleague Letters</h3>
			<h4>House</h4>
			<p>The bipartisan house letter is led by <b>Representatives Bera and Wagner.</b></p>
			<br>
			<h4>Senate</h4>
			<p>The bipartisan house letter is led by <b>Senators Young and Rosen.</b></p>
