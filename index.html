					<h2>Tuberculosis (TB) is the world's most <span class="red">deadly</span> infectious disease.</h2>
					<p>A total of 1.6 million people died from tuberculosis in 2021&ndash;with more than 30% being undiagnosed.</p>
					<p>Worldwide, TB is the 15th leading cause of death and the second leading infectious killer after COVID-19 (above HIV and AIDS).</p>
					<p>TB symptoms may be mild for many months, so it is easy to spread TB to others without knowing it.</p>

					<h2>...and it's <span class="red">curable</span></h2>
					<p>An estimated 4 million lives were saved from TB diagnosis and treatment between 2000 and 2021.</p>
					<p>However, access to TB treatment and diagnosis is highly unequal globally. Only about 1 in 3 people with drug resistant TB accessed treatment in 2021.</p>

					<h2>Enter <span class="red">Danaher</span>.</h2>
					<p>Danaher is a large and powerful corporation based in the U.S. that owns multiple biotech companies, including Cepheid. Cepheid is a molecular diagnostics company that&ndash;through their GeneXpert diagnostics technology&ndash;has revolutionized diagnosis of many diseases, including tuberculosis.</p>
					<p>With just one test, doctors can quickly determine not only if a patient has TB, but if it is resistant to certain type of medicines, making treatment more effective.</p>
					<p>Sounds great, right?</p>

					<h2><span class="red">Profits</span> over People.</h2>
					<p>However, Danaher uses what many call and "printer ink" business model when it comes to GeneXpert. If you've ever bought printer ink, you know that the printer is usually sold for a reasonable price, but the ink is often sold at a very inflated price. Danaher prices GeneXpert in a similar way.</p>
					<p>The testing machines are moderately priced, but a single test cartridge can run upwards of $10-15. And for low income and impoverished communities that need it the most, that's simply not affordable.</p>
