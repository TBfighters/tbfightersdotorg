						Tuberculosis (TB) is the world's
						<span class="red">deadliest</span> infectious disease.
					</h2>
					<p>
						A total of 1.6 million people died from tuberculosis in 2021&ndash;with more than 30% being
						undiagnosed.<br />
						Worldwide, TB is the 13th leading cause of death and the leading infectious killer after
						COVID-19 (above HIV and AIDS).<br />
						TB symptoms may be mild for many months, so it is easy to spread TB to others without knowing
						it.

					<h2>...and it's <span class="red">curable</span></h2>
					<p>
						An estimated 74 million lives were saved from TB diagnosis and treatment between 2000 and
						2021.<br />
						However, TB treatment and diagnosis have unfairly high prices to the point that many who need it
						can't afford it.<br />
						Only about 1 in 3 people with drug-resistant TB accessed treatment in 2021.

					<h2>Enter <span class="red">Danaher</span>.</h2>
					<p>
						Danaher - a large U.S. corporation - owns many smaller biotech companies, including Cepheid.<br />
						Cepheid designs and manufactures diagnostic tests. Their TB GeneXpert test determines whether a
						patient has TB and if it is resistant to certain TB drugs, enabling effective treatment.<br />
						GeneXpert tests give fast results without a need for a fully equipped laboratory. That should
						make them an accessible option everywhere.<br />
						Sounds great, right?

				</div>
			</section>
			<section id="profits" class="container">
				<div class="wrapper wrapper-right">
					<h2><span class="red">Profits</span> over People.</h2>
					<p>
						However, Danaher uses what many call a “printer ink” business model when it comes to
						GeneXpert.<br />
						While a printer is usually sold for a reasonable price, the ink is often extremely expensive,
						with a high profit margin. Danaher prices GeneXpert in a similar way.<br />
						The reusable machines used to process these tests are moderately priced, but an individual test
						cartridge can run upwards of $10-15 dollars.<br />
						In Sierra Leone - a country with a very high rate of tuberculosis - that is the same as the
						average wage for an entire week. That's simply not affordable.<br />
						<br />
						We are calling on Cepheid and Danaher to prioritize people's lives over maximizing profits by
						dropping the price of all GeneXpert tests, which cost about $3 to make, to $5.
