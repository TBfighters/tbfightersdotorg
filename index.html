						Tuberculosis is the world's
						<span class="red">deadliest</span> infectious disease.
					</h2>
					<p>A total of 1.6 million people died from tuberculosis (TB) in 2021 while almost 40% of cases go undiagnosed.</p>
					<p>
						Worldwide, TB is currently the 13th leading cause of death and the leading infectious killer
						– ahead of HIV/AIDS and COVID-19.

					<h2>...and it's <span class="red">curable</span></h2>
					<p>An estimated 74 million lives were saved through TB diagnosis and treatment between 2000 and 2021.</p>
					<p>However, TB treatment and diagnosis are prohibitively expensive to the point that many who need them can’t afford it.</p>
					<p>Only <strong>1 in 3</strong> people with drug-resistant TB were able to access treatment in 2021 because of gaps in testing and treatment.</p>

					<h2>Enter <span class="red">Danaher</span>.</h2>
					<p>
						Danaher - a large U.S. corporation - owns many smaller biotech companies, including Cepheid.
						Cepheid designs and manufactures diagnostic tests. Their TB GeneXpert test determines whether
						someone has tuberculosis and if the infection is drug resistant or not, enabling effective treatment.<br>
						GeneXpert tests give fast results without the need for a fully equipped laboratory which should make them accessible.
					</p>
					<p>
						Sounds great, right?

					<h2><span class="red">Profits</span> over People.</h2>
					<p>However, Danaher uses what many call a “printer-ink” business model when it comes to the GeneXpert system.
						While a printer is usually sold for a reasonable price, the ink is often extremely expensive, with a high profit margin.
						Danaher prices GeneXpert in a similar way.
					</p>
					<p>The reusable machines used to process these tests are moderately priced, but the least expensive Xpert tuberculosis cartridges cost nearly $10.
						In Sierra Leone – a country with a high rate of tuberculosis – this is the same as the median weekly wage.
						That’s simply not affordable.
						Xpert cartridges for diagnosing TB have been estimated to cost as little as $3 to manufacture.
					</p>
					<p>
						We call on Cepheid and Danaher to prioritize people’s lives over maximizing profits by dropping the price of all Xpert cartridges to $5.
