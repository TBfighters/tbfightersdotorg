		<p>
			<img src="assets/img/hourglass.png" class="image-right about-hourglass" style="max-width:150px;">TBFighters is a collective of <a href="resources.html#glossary">Nerdfighters</a> and global health activists committed to fighting the structural causes of <a href="resources.html">tuberculosis (TB)</a>. TB has been curable for decades. It continues to kill 1.3 million people a year because of human choices. The TBFighters group and this website were originally created to support the <a href="https://msfaccess.org/time-for-5" target="_blank">Time for $5 campaign</a> for lower tuberculosis test prices, after <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSC06P9A5W4">John Green introduced Nerdfighteria to the campaign</a> in September 2023.
		</p>
		<p>
			We lead by following and we act with compassion. That means we follow the guidance of public health experts, including <a href="https://www.pih.org/" target="_blank">Partners in Health</a> and <a href="https://www.msfaccess.org/" target="_blank">Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors Without Borders)</a>, and the TB-affected communities who have needlessly suffered from this curable disease.
