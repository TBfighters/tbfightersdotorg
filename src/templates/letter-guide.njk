	<br>
	<br>
	<p>Here's some instructions for help with sending your letter!</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<b>Write your letter.</b>
			<br>
			<ol type="a">
				<li>
					You can choose to write a formal business letter based
					off of
					one of our templates and print it, write a handwritten
					letter,
					or get creative with a card or drawing.
				</li>
				<li>We hope that Danaher will read at least some of our letters,
					but
					can’t be sure. However, we’d love for you to share what
					you
					write on social media! If you are, remember to take a
					picture
					before you seal your envelope in the next step.</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li><b>Put your letter in an envelope.</b>
			<ol type="a">
				<li>
					You can usually buy envelopes at the post office or
					office
					supply store, but most grocery stores and drug stores
					will have
					options as well. Envelopes typically aren’t sold
					individually,
					so check to see if you have one at home if you don’t
					want to end
					up with a box.
				</li>
				<li>Neatly fold your letter and seal it in the envelope.</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Address your envelope.</b>
			<ol type="a">
				<li>
					<p>To address your letter to Danaher’s board write this
						on the
						front of your envelope (the side without a flap)
						in the
						center:</p>
					<div class="block">
						<p>c/o Corporate Secretary</p>
						<p>Danaher Corporation</p>
						<p>2200 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W.</p>
						<p>Suite 800W</p>
						<p>Washington, D.C. 20037-1701</p>
						<p>USA</p>
					</div>

				</li>
				<li>
					<p>If you'd like to address it to an individual member
						of the
						board, here’s some important members you can
						pick from.
						Add your selection on top of the line “c/o
						Corporate
						Secretary” in the address above.</p>
					<ol type="i">
						<li><a href="https://investors.danaher.com/board-of-directors?item=7"
								target="_blank">Rainer
								Blair</a> President and CEO of
							Danaher,
							whose pay has more than doubled since
							2020, now
							at $20 million per year.</li>
						<li>The founders, <a
								href="https://investors.danaher.com/board-of-directors?item=19"
								target="_blank">Steven</a>
							and <a href="https://investors.danaher.com/board-of-directors?item=18"
								target="_blank">Mitchell</a>
							Rales</li>
						<li>
							Other members of the board: Dr. Pardis
							Sabeti
							(past Crash Course host), Dr. Jessica
							Mega,
							Professor Raymond Stevens, and Dr. Elias
							Zerhouni (former Gates Foundation
							fellow).
						</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<h4>Example Letter</h4>

				 width="100%" class="letter" id="example-letter">
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Optional: Add your return address.</b>
			<ol type="a">
				<li>Return addresses are not required for standard mail
					in the US. If you don’t want to use your
					address, feel free to omit it. We do recommend
					including a return address if you’re comfortable
					to make it seem more legitimate.</li>
				<li>
					<p>To add a return address, write it in the top left
						corner of
						the front of the envelope. Here’s the format for
						US
						addresses:</p>
					<div class="block">
						<p>Alexander Hamilton</p>
						<p>58 Partition Street</p>
						<p>New York, NY 10038</p>
						<br>
						<em>If you don’t know your zip code (10038 in
							this
							example), you can find it by googling
							the rest
							of your address.</em>
					</div>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Add postage.</b>
			<ol type="a">
				<li>
					In the US, normal letter postage stamps (also called
					Forever
					Stamps) cost $0.68 right now. You can buy stamps at your
					local
					post office or <a
						href="https://store.usps.com/store/results/stamps/_/N-9y93lv?utm_medium=search&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=evergreenps&utm_content=e332_eese&gad=1"
						target="_blank">buy
						them online</a> from USPS. Stamps are also
					available at
					some grocery stores, gas stations, and pharmacies,
					usually at
					the register.
				</li>
				<li>A standard $0.68 forever stamp can mail up to one ounce, or
					about
					four sheets of paper plus an envelope. If you’re mailing
					more
					sheets or heavier paper, you may need additional
					postage. Ask
					for help at the Post Office counter.</li>
				<li>If you are mailing a letter from outside the US, you may
					need to buy
					an international stamp. Check your local postal service
					for
					details.</li>
				<li>Affix your stamp to the upper right corner of the front of
					the
					envelope.</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Mail your letter!</b>
			<ol type="a">
				<li>Option 1: If you live in a house with a mailbox at the curb,
					you can
					just put your letter in your mailbox and raise the flag.
				</li>
				<li>Option 2: If you live in an apartment building or shared
					housing
					complex, there may be an outgoing mail slot in the
					mailbox area.
				</li>
				<li>Option 3: Go to your local post office. Most will have a
					letter slot
					or dropbox you can use without talking to anyone. You
					can also
					walk up to the counter and ask for help.</li>
				<li>Option 4: Find a local USPS collection box by searching for
					your
					address <a
						href="https://tools.usps.com/find-location.htm?locationType=collectionbox&address=10020&searchRadius=1&fdbid=1001900018&latitude=40.76109&longitude=-73.9796&"
						target="_blank">here</a>.
				</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Optional: Post your letter on social media and tag Danaher.</b>
			<ol type="a">
				<li>Use the tag #PeopleOverProfits or #TimeFor5 in your post!
				</li>
			</ol>
		</li>

			<p class="date">[Date]</p>
			<p>To the Board of Directors, Danaher Corporation,</p>
			<br>
			<p>I’m reaching out to you out of concern for the millions of people
				living with dangerous diseases who do not receive a diagnosis.
				Your GeneXpert machines can diagnose Ebola, HIV, extensively
				drug-resistant TB, hepatitis, and many common sexually
				transmitted infections, but they are out of reach to the people
				who need them most because of unreasonably high prices. </p>
			<br>
			<p>Independent research has shown that you can make a fair profit at
				$5, which would allow governments and organizations to scale up
				testing, but these tests currently cost $15-$20, too expensive
				for many who need them. Millions of people continue to die of
				treatable diseases but your tests could help change that. </p>
			<br>
			<p>I urge you to continue showing your commitment to putting people
				over profits by lowering all your tests to $5 and helping save
				millions of lives. </p>
			<br>
			<p>I look forward to working with you as we help to bring an end to the
				terrible impact tuberculosis and drug-resistant tuberculosis
				have on
				people living outside of high-income countries.</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				Regards,
			</p>

		<h3>Option 2</h3>
		<div id="option-2">
			<p class="date">[Date]</p>
			<p>To the Board of Directors, Danaher
				Corporation:</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				As you know, tuberculosis (TB) is one of the most deadly
				infectious diseases in the world, killing 1.3 million people in
				2022. Many people and organizations around the world have been
				working to help put an end to that horrifying statistic, and
				your tests are a crucial part of it. Lowering the price of your
				MTB/RIF tests is a massive step in the right direction, allowing
				millions more people to quickly and accurately get tested for TB
				and rifampin resistance, but that alone is not enough.
			</p>

			<br>
			<p>
				In 2022, around 410,000 people developed a form of
				drug-resistant TB, but only about 2 in 5 were diagnosed and
				given appropriate treatment. Your Xpert MTB/XDR tests can
				diagnose resistance to an incredible number of TB drugs, which
				would allow those people to be quickly and safely treated for
				the most dangerous forms of TB without unnecessary exposure to
				toxic and unsafe treatments.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				Ebola virus disease can have a fatality rate as high as 90%
				without effective preventative and supportive care. Xpert Ebola
				cartridges could help save lives by ensuring quick medical care
				and allowing people at risk of infection to receive preventative
				care.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				HIV/AIDS continues to affect many people globally, with an
				estimated 39 million people living with HIV at the end of 2022.
				620,000 people died from HIV-related causes in 2022, including
				the 167,000 people with HIV who died of tuberculosis,
				emphasizing the need for appropriate HIV prevention and
				treatment in the fight to end TB, but 14% of people with HIV
				don’t know their status. Your Xpert tests for HIV allow quick
				and accurate diagnosis, as well as the ability to assess a
				person's response to antiretroviral therapy.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver that can be caused by
				infectious diseases such as hepatitis B virus (HBV) and
				hepatitis C virus (HCV) which together accounted for 1.11
				million deaths in 2019. Though a vaccine is available for HBV
				prevention, no cure is available and people with infections
				require lifelong treatment. Effective treatment depends on
				diagnosing HBV and assessing its severity as early as possible,
				but only 10.5% of people estimated to be living with the disease
				were aware of their infection as of 2022. Hepatitis C virus is
				curable, yet 290,000 people died from it in 2019, partly due to
				a lack of diagnosis. Xpert cartridges are crucial to a fast and
				accurate diagnosis of both HBV and HCV, as well as continued
				monitoring of the diseases.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				What do all these diseases have in common? You manufacture fast
				and effective tests for all of them, and yet they are still
				underdiagnosed in many low- to middle-income settings. We have
				the technology to save millions of lives, but at a cost of
				$15-20 per cartridge, it is prohibitively expensive. Your
				amazing tests only have the capacity to do good when they’re
				accessible to those who need them, and charging as much as
				double the median weekly wage in countries like Sierra Leone is
				not accessible. With nominal differences in the manufacturing
				processes between tests it is possible to make a reasonable
				profit on all of them at a price of $5. Every one of these tests
				can do an amazing amount of good for the world, but when it’s
				possible to make a fair and reasonable profit at $5, selling
				them for $15-20–three to four times that price–prevents them
				from having that impact.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				While I eagerly anticipate the release of transparent
				information about the cost to produce MTB/RIF cartridges (your
				baseline TB tests), and greatly appreciate the steps you’ve
				taken towards more equitable testing, charging people in low- to
				middle-income countries $15-20 for life-saving diagnostics is
				not the correct path forward to helping reduce the toll of these
				curable diseases.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				3,600 people are dying because of TB every day. 1,700 people are
				dying because of HIV every day. 3,000 people are dying because
				of hepatitis every day. Together we can put an end to the
				terrible and disproportionate tolls these diseases take on
				people living outside of high-income countries, but the first
				step is reasonable pricing for your lifesaving tests.
