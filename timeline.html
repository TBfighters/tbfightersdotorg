							<a href="https://twitter.com/JNJNews/status/1679168314986094592" target="_blank">Johnson &amp; Johnson responds publicly to the #PeopleOverProfits campaign</a> with a statement on Twitter that reads, in part: "It is false to suggest—as some recently have—that our patents are being used to prevent access to SIRTURO® (bedaquiline), our medicine for MDR-TB." Their statement touts J&amp;J's work in developing and donating TB-related treatments, and admits that the lack of testing is the highest barrier to treatment.
						</p>
						<p>
							TBFighters respond, in part, with the small impact that Johnson &amp; Johnson's 600,000 courses of donated bedaquiline over 10 years has had on the 32 million people who died from TB during that time frame. "It is false to suggest—as some recently have—" becomes a meme and rallying cry for TBFighters.

						</p>
						<p>
							TBFighters flood Johnson &amp; Johnson's phone lines, emails, and social media, telling them to adhere to their credo, which partially reads: "Our first responsibility is to the patients." This also marks the adoption of the #PeopleOverProfits hashtag and message by TBFighters and other groups involved in the Time For $5 campaign. The hashtag trends on several platforms over the next few days.
