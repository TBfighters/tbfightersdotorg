							MSF Access <a href="https://timefor5.msfaccess.org/" target="_blank">releases a petition</a> calling on Danaher to lower all GeneXpert test cartridges to $5 in low- and middle-income countries. The following Tuesday, John Green <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uizFXzSTeVs" target="_blank">releases a video</a> supporting the petition and discussing his intention to engage in shareholder activism. TBFighters sign and amplify the petition, and continue to call, email, and post on social media, pushing for all test prices to be lowered to $5, not just MTB/RIF tests at $7.97.

This builds upon their previous agreement with the Stop TB Partnership (see July 13), which allowed for generic bedaquiline in 44 countries, and <strong>fulfills the initial ask of the #PatientsOverPatents campaign</strong>.

							<a href="https://twitter.com/JNJNews/status/1679168314986094592" target="_blank">Johnson &amp; Johnson responds publicly to the #PeopleOverProfits campaign</a> with a statement on Twitter that reads, in part: "It is false to suggest—as some recently have—that our patents are being used to prevent access to SIRTURO® (bedaquiline), our medicine for MDR-TB." Their statement touts J&amp;J's work in developing and donating TB-related treatments, and admits that the lack of testing is the highest barrier to treatment.
						</p>
						<p>
							TBFighters respond, in part, with the small impact that Johnson &amp; Johnson's 600,000 courses of donated bedaquiline over 10 years has had on the 32 million people who died from TB during that time frame. "It is false to suggest—as some recently have—" becomes a meme and rallying cry for TBFighters.

							<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMhgw5SW0h4" target="_blank">John Green announces an effort to ask Johnson &amp; Johnson to allow their patents on bedaquiline to lapse</a> without enforcing secondary patents, at least in countries that have a high tuberculosis burden or are considered low- to middle-income.
						</p>
						<p>
							TBFighters flood Johnson &amp; Johnson's phone lines, emails, and social media, telling them to adhere to their credo, which partially reads: "Our first responsibility is to the patients." This also marks the adoption of the #PeopleOverProfits hashtag and message by TBFighters and other groups involved in the Time For $5 campaign. The hashtag trends on several platforms over the next few days.
